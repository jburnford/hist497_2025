# Digital History Python Notebooks - Improvement Plan

## Overview
Refining three Jupyter notebooks to introduce 4th year digital history students to Python, strings, and web scraping. The goal is to expand content, add more hands-on exercises, and incorporate better historical data sources.

## Current Notebook Status
